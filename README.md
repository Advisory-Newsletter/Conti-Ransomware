2) Ensure network segmentation via the usage of demilitarized zones (DMZs) and network traffic management controls are in...
3) Ensure assets and software are routinely patched and updated.
4) Use application allowlisting, preventing employees from installing illegitimate applications or unauthorized software.
5) Implement endpoint and detection response tools. Endpoint and detection response tools like ReaQta-Hive provide unparalleled visibility into the security status of     endpoints and proactively secure organisations against malicious cyber actors.
6) Control access to resources over the network, i.e restricting RDP.
